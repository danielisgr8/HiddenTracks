# Hidden Tracks Model
This directory contains the API model for the Hidden Tracks service. It is written in [Smithy](https://smithy.io/2.0/index.html).

The model is used to generate a JavaScript client, `@danielisgr8/hidden-tracks-client`, that is used by the website.

## Development
To build the model and generate the JavaScript client, run `./gradlew build`.
